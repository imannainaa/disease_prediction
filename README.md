For this project, we will be predicting multiple disease prediction such as diabetes, parkinson and heart disease based on the user's input. The prediction's algorithm is as follows:
Diabetes prediction: SVC 
Heart disease prediction: logistic regression
Parkinson prediction: SVM

Project's workflow:
1. Build prediction model for each disease.
2. Import model to .sav format
3. Build a web application using streamlit
